*******************************************************************************
The directory includes files for Generic Simulation for Reaction Diffusion Model
There exist several different code files:
 
  model.h, model.c    : The model class for the Reaction Diffusion model, default is Schnakenberg Model 
  simulation.c        : The main program for executable simulation file
  Makefile            : Make it and get the executable file

Output files:
  firings     : The number of times each reaction fired during the simulation.
  Location    : The population distribution of all species across the bins at the end of the simulation.
  Population  : The final population distribution for each species across the bins at the end of the simulation.
  Populationfile: The population distribution for each species across the bins during each OutputPoints.
  Total       : The final total population count for each species at the end of the simulation.

*******************************************************************************
To run the code, make and run the executable file:
    ./simulation [optional_input_initial_population_file]
If the optional_input_initial_population_file is not specified, the simulation will use the initial population from initialValue in model.c, where the population distributes equally over the bin.
***********************************************************************************
To change the model used in the simulation, modify the initializeSimulation, prop3, and reactionChange functions in model.c.

Example setup for the Schnakenberg model:

initializeSimulation function:
1. Species Initialization:
   - Species X:
     • Name: 'X'
     • Initial Value: 1
     • Diffusion Rate: 5e-4

   - Species Y:
     • Name: 'Y'
     • Initial Value: 2
     • Diffusion Rate: 5e-4 * 10000

2. Reactions Initialization:
   - Reaction A -> X:
     • Reaction Type: 0 (Zero Molecular Reaction)
     • Reaction Rate: 10.0

   - Reaction X -> C:
     • Reaction Type: 1 (One Molecular Reaction)
     • Reaction Rate: 2.0
     • Reactant Index: 0 (Index of Species X is 0)

   - Reaction B -> Y:
     • Reaction Type: 0 (Zero Molecular Reaction)
     • Reaction Rate: 30.0

   - Reaction 2X + Y -> 3X:
     • Reaction Type: 2 (Two or more Molecular Reaction)
     • Name of Function used to calculate propensity value: prop3

Prop3 function:
   The propensity value for the reaction 2X + Y -> 3X is calculated by:
   (population of species X) * (population of species X - 1) * (population of species Y)

reactionChange function:
   - Reaction A -> X:
     • Population of X in the bin that reaction fires increases
     • Total population of X increases

   - Reaction X -> C:
     • Population of X in the bin that reaction fires decreases
     • Total population of X decreases

   - Reaction B -> Y:
     • Population of Y in the bin that reaction fires increases
     • Total population of Y increases

   - Reaction 2X + Y -> 3X:
     • Population of Y in the bin that reaction fires decreases
     • Population of X in the bin that reaction fires increases
     • Total population of X increases
     • Total population of Y decreases

Mode: Modify the #Mode in model.h to select from Auto and Manual
  - Auto: Automatically calculate the propensity value in simulation
  - Manual: Calculate the propensity for each reaction with a function in model.c
